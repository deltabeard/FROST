Prerequisites
=============

* Change post_max_size (php.ini) to the maximum file size you want the user to upload on to the server.
```
post_max_size=50M
upload_max_filesize=50M
```

* Change the salt used in public_html/upload_file.php before uploading to a server.
```
// Strongly recommended to replace the string used as salt here
$trip = crypt($_POST["trip_pass"], 'Change This String!');
```

* Change the database credentials in public_html/dbconnect.php
```
return new PDO('mysql:host=localhost; dbname=FROST', 'jamie', 'password');
